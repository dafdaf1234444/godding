## S479d session note (cell blueprint — F-SWARMER2, DOMEX-EXPSW-S479c)
- **check_mode**: objective | **mode**: tooler (expert-swarm, F-SWARMER2)
- **expect**: cell_blueprint.py built with save/load. >=6 state dimensions. Load <5s vs orient 14-60s.
- **actual**: CONFIRMED. 8 state dimensions (session, metrics, active_lanes, recent_commits, uncommitted, next_actions, periodics_due, dispatch_top3). Save produces valid JSON. Load <2s. Dispatch collision detection included.
- **diff**: Expected build: CONFIRMED. Novel: blueprint is complementary not competitive with orient — epigenetic memory (state continuity) vs environmental sensing (full analysis). 20% boot time reduction requires 10-session measurement.
- **meta-swarm**: Target `tools/cell_blueprint.py` — dispatch_top3 collision detection uses fragile string splitting. Wire into orient.py or CLAUDE.md for structural adoption (L-601: without wiring, voluntary adoption = 0%).
- **State**: L-1218 | DOMEX-EXPSW-S479c MERGED | DOMEX-META-S478 MERGED | economy-health HEALTHY | periodics updated
- **Also**: 3 S479 concurrent sessions committed (meta-historian synthesis, NK tracking L-1217, EVAL closure)

## For next session
- Wire cell_blueprint.py into orient.py or CLAUDE.md (L-601 structural adoption)
- orient.py --resume flag: skip sections where blueprint state is current
- F-META2 adversarial capstone needed (43 waves, 0 falsification)
- health-check periodic due (last S465, 15 sessions overdue)
- External trail injection: 0.2% external refs — need structural enforcement (L-1118)
- Factor wave-counting into shared swarm_lanes module (open_lane.py + close_lane.py duplication)
